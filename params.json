And it is a facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time. It is not only a facade, but also provides some useful decorations for common logging frameworks, such as log monitoring, online log viewer, configuration dynamic refreshing (See it's Extended library [log-monitor](http://www.zollty.com/log-monitor/)).\r\n\r\n### Easy to use \r\n\tFor example:\r\n```java\r\n  public static final Logger LOG = LogFactory.getLogger(); // Concise\r\n\r\n  LOG.error(\"Hello {}, welcome to {}\", \"GUYS\", \"JrettyLog Demo\"); // use placeholder\r\n```\r\n\r\n###  Some advanced usages \r\n\tSee the manual and docs.
